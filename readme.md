## üóìÔ∏è Timeline/Gantt View Component

This project implements a sophisticated, interactive Timeline/Gantt View component, fulfilling the requirements of the Frontend Developer Hiring Assignment.

üéØ **Objective**
[cite\_start]The primary goal was to build a production-grade, highly performant, and accessible horizontal time-based project visualization tool with resource allocation and task dependency features, all while adhering to a strict component architecture and design system principles[cite: 4, 5, 14].

### üíª Installation

To run the project locally and view the Storybook:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone timeline-component-[yourname]
cd timeline-component-[yourname]

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run Storybook locally
npm run storybook
```

[cite\_start]All stories should render correctly at `http://localhost:6006` (or similar)[cite: 419, 448].

### üß± Architecture

[cite\_start][Brief explanation of your component architecture][cite: 419].

  * [cite\_start]**Component Structure:** Explain how components like `TimelineView.tsx`, `TimelineGrid.tsx`, `TimelineRow.tsx`, and `TaskBar.tsx` are structured and interact[cite: 59, 60].
  * [cite\_start]**State Management:** Describe how state is managed (e.g., local React state, **Zustand** or **Jotai** if used)[cite: 29].
  * [cite\_start]**Data Flow:** Explain how the `TimelineViewProps` (rows, tasks, viewMode) are consumed and how updates (`onTaskUpdate`, `onTaskMove`) are handled[cite: 182, 189, 190].
  * [cite\_start]**Performance:** Detail the use of **`React.memo()`**, **`useCallback`**, **`useMemo`**, and potential **virtualization** for large datasets[cite: 320, 321, 325].

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

The following core and advanced features have been implemented:

  * [cite\_start][x] Timeline grid with time scale and sticky left panel[cite: 191, 195].
  * [cite\_start][x] Task bar rendering with progress indication and milestone support[cite: 200, 218].
  * [cite\_start][x] Task **drag-and-drop** (Move to new row and/or date range)[cite: 235].
  * [cite\_start][x] Task **resizing** (Adjust start and end dates)[cite: 235].
  * [cite\_start][x] Task **Dependency Lines** (SVG/Canvas lines connecting predecessor end to dependent start)[cite: 236, 237].
  * [cite\_start][x] **View Mode Switching** (Day, Week, Month views with corresponding time units)[cite: 188, 199].
  * [cite\_start][x] **Current Date Indicator**[cite: 197, 255].
  * [cite\_start][x] **Task Detail Sidebar/Modal** on click[cite: 260].
  * [cite\_start][x] **Accessibility** (Keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, focus management)[cite: 278, 280, 283].

### üìö Storybook Stories

The following required stories have been implemented and documented:

  * [cite\_start]**Default Story:** Basic timeline with sample tasks[cite: 36, 443].
  * [cite\_start]**Empty State Story:** Timeline with no tasks[cite: 37, 443].
  * [cite\_start]**Large Dataset Story:** Demonstration of performance with 30+ tasks across multiple rows[cite: 431, 443].
  * [cite\_start]**Mobile View Story:** Responsive layout demonstration[cite: 38, 443].
  * [cite\_start]**Interactive Demo Story:** Fully functional drag, resize, and edit capabilities[cite: 38, 443].
  * [cite\_start]**Week View Story:** Specific demonstration of the week-level time scale[cite: 431, 443].
  * [cite\_start]**Accessibility Story:** Demonstration of full keyboard navigation and ARIA implementation[cite: 38, 431, 443].

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

  * [cite\_start]**Component Framework:** React [cite: 18]
  * [cite\_start]**Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode Enabled) [cite: 18, 348]
  * [cite\_start]**Styling:** Tailwind CSS [cite: 18]
  * [cite\_start]**Build Tooling:** Vite / Next.js (as specified) [cite: 19]
